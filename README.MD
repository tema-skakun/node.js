## About
In this project, I learned Node.js, a server-side technology that allows you to execute code written in JavaScript outside of the browser.

I analyzed the basic concepts and built-in modules that are actively used in server development. Considered the mechanism of communication between the server and the browser.

I did:
- created basic routing using pure Node.js
- connected Express and rewrote the router
- learned to work with dynamic data using the Node.js template engine
- wrote a news application with support for CRUD operations and data storage in MongoDB
- created my own API for returning data from the database
- uploaded the finished application to ~~Heroku~~ [Render](https://blog-node-js-rnkc.onrender.com).
